Rachid’s Sort Library Project README

About: 
  This project was a personal project that I did because I wanted to start programming in the C programming language. In addition, I wanted to strengthen my knowledge of different sorting techniques and general algorithm design. This project is an ongoing project that I will periodically update as time goes on.

Executable File Use: 
  The executable file associated with this project is basically several unit tests of the sorting algorithms that I implemented. The executable file will show if the sorting algorithm, based on the variables passed to the sortTest() function, succeeds in sorting the elements of the sample array or not.

Source Code Use: 
  The source code associated with this project is free for anyone to use and possibly extend if they wish. If one has found any bugs or has any suggestions relating to the source code, please feel free to comment on the project page or e-mail me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.

Final Notes: 
  This project really helped me understand pointer arithmetic and memory manipulation on a much deeper level. In addition, it has helped me gain deeper insight into sorting algorithms and has helped me appreciate the hard work that later programming languages do under the hood in order to make programmer’s lives easier. I hope my fellow coders will learn as much as I did and find the source code helpful to fill their needs. If you have read this, thank you for visiting my GitHub page, it is much appreciated.
